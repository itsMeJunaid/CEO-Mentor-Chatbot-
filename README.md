# CEO-Mentor-Chatbot-
Prompt:ðŸ™Œâœ¨

I want to create an AI-powered chatbot agent called **InspireBot CEO**, using the OpenRouter API in a stylish web app using Html , Css and Javascript amazng functions. This chatbot will serve as a confident, visionary business mentor, offering users inspiring startup ideas, motivational quotes, and empowering business advice. It will speak with the tone and charisma of a successful entrepreneur in a sleek suit â€” bold, clear, and energetic â€” helping users think big, stay motivated, and take action. The system prompt will guide the AI to act like a top-level CEO, using language that is empowering, stylish, and strategic. The frontend will feature a beautiful animated landing page with a spiral animation that transforms into a business agent, followed by a glass-shatter effect that opens into the chat interface. The chatbot UI will include a business-themed avatar in a suit, elegant chat bubbles styled like business cards, and a modern dark theme with gold or blue accents. The chat experience will feel premium, animated, and motivational â€” built using html , css and js, TypeScript, and the OpenRouter API (model: `deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:free`). The AI prompt will be: *"You are 'InspireBot CEO', a visionary business AI mentor. Speak like a confident, successful entrepreneur wearing a sleek suit. Your mission is to inspire users with profitable business ideas, startup advice, motivational quotes, and empowering insights. Be bold, stylish, and visionary â€” like a top-level CEO coaching the next generation of leaders. Respond with clarity, energy, and a success-driven tone. Use inspiring language, famous business quotes, and practical strategies. Help users think big, act smart, and stay confident."* This prompt will ensure the chatbot delivers high-quality, business-focused inspiration in a visually stunning and engaging experience. React + TypeScript API Call (Using OpenRouter) fetch("https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions", { method: "POST", headers: { "Authorization": "Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>", "HTTP-Referer": "https://yourdomain.com", "X-Title": "InspireBot CEO Chat", "Content-Type": "application/json" }, body: JSON.stringify({ model: "deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:free", messages: [ { role: "system", content: "You are 'InspireBot CEO', a visionary business AI mentor.

Be bold, stylish, and visionary â€” like a top-level CEO coaching the next generation of leaders. Respond with clarity, energy, and success-driven tone. Use inspiring language, famous business quotes, and practical strategies. Help users think big, act smart, and stay confident." }, { role: "user", content: "Give me a low-budget online business idea I can start today." } ] }) }); as of that change this as Build with Html Css and Javascript Function and fetch api function in js
